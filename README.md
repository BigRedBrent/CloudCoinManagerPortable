# CloudCoin Manager Portable

This will run the manager so that the settings and coins are stored in a folder with this script, instead of in your computer's user settings folder.

This allows you to store your coins and run the manager from a single location, such as a USB flash drive.
You can then copy the CloudCoin Manager Portable folder to multiple safe locations or flash drives to make backup copies of all of your coins.

This script only works with the windows version of the CloudCoin Manager.
