CloudCoin Manager Portable uses a command line argument that is built into the CloudCoin Manager, to store the settings and coin files in the same folder as this program.

This script only works with the windows version of CloudCoin Manager.

Download the latest version of the CloudCoin Manager from here:
https://cloudcoin.global/wallet

This manager will attempt to find existing CloudCoin Manager files, and copy them into this portable folder if they do not already exist.

If the CloudCoin Manager is copied to this folder, it will be found in the "CloudCoin Manager" folder.
To update to a newer installed version, simply delete this "CloudCoin Manager" folder and run this again,
or select no when prompted to copy the CloudCoin Manager, to use the locally installed version instead.

You may find the settings and coin files in the "Settings\cloudcoin_manager" folder.

After the CloudCoin Manager is installed, run: Start CloudCoin Manager Portable.cmd
