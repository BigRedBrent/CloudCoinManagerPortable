CloudCoin Manager Portable uses a command line argument that is built into the CloudCoin Manager, to store the settings and coin files in the same folder as this script, instead of in your computer's local user settings folder.

This allows you to store your coins and run the manager from a single location, such as a USB flash drive.  
You can then copy the "CloudCoin Manager Portable" folder to multiple safe locations or flash drives to make backup copies of all of your coins.  


This script only works with the windows version of CloudCoin Manager.

This manager will attempt to find existing CloudCoin Manager files, and copy them into this portable folder if they do not already exist.  
If copied, the already existing files will not be altered in any way.

You may find the settings and coin files in the "Settings" folder.  
To start with a new blank copy of settings, select no when prompted to copy existing settings.  
If you want to remove any existing settings files that have been successfully coped, you will be responsible to find and delete them yourself.  
Existing settings files are located in a directory that looks like this: "C:\Users\{USER}\cloudcoin_manager"

To use the locally installed CloudCoin Manager, select no when prompted to copy the CloudCoin Manager.  
To copy the CloudCoin Manager to the portable folder after originally selecting not to,  
simply delete the "CloudCoin Manager" folder and run this script again.

After the CloudCoin Manager is installed, run: "Start CloudCoin Manager Portable.cmd"
